# SeniorDesign

This code is incorporated in the Smart Chess Board senior design project which combines both over the board and online chess methods of play into one convenient package. The product allows one person playing with physical pieces to play against a virtual player that uses a virtual display on a computer, and both the physical board and virtual board update according to the playersâ€™ moves. The product consists of a box with a chess board, button, and digital display on top, along with a mounted camera above the board. The code included here includes the computer vision and chess engine code running on a Raspberry Pi 4 in the pieceloc.py file, as well as the MovementSM.ino file running on the Arduino Mega.
